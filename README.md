# POSET games demonstrator

This is a demonstration of games that can be represented by removing elements of partially ordered sets.

Coin Stack is currently the main game. It is an [impartial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game), [normal play-convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_play_convention) game where players remove coins from the top of a stack. The player who is forced to take the last coin loses.
